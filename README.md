This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and [Redocly](https://redocly.com/) boilerplate.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This boiler is all about using NextJS for documentation of APIs. Redocly is framework which suppots JSON and YAML format for API documentation and also React components for simple rendering.

There is also an example of YAML file in the repo for convenience.
